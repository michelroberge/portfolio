# Development Plan Summary

## Objective

Enhance the portfolio & blog platform by addressing gaps in configuration, authentication, comments, content management, admin features, search functionality, and non-functional requirements using a Test-Driven Development approach.

   - Refactor code for dependency injection and modularity.

### 2. Authentication Enhancements:
   - Implement first-time admin setup flow.
   - Add consumer OAuth2/OIDC endpoints.
   - Write comprehensive unit/integration tests.

### 3. Comment System Improvements:

   - Develop REST endpoints for comment CRUD.
   - Write tests for validation, authorization, and edge cases.

### 4. Content Management Enhancements:

   - Implement admin onboarding wizard.
   - Write integration and E2E tests for admin flows.

### 6. Search Functionality:
   - Implement full-text search on blog posts and projects.
   - Create API endpoints and write search tests.

### 7. Non-Functional Improvements:
   - Enhance SEO with dynamic meta tags and structured data.
   - Improve accessibility and prepare for internationalization.
   - Optimize caching and monitor performance.
   - Write tests/audits for SEO and accessibility.

### 8. Deployment:
   - Maintain Docker Compose deployment.
   - Update Dockerfiles and write integration tests for container startup.

## Outcome:
A robust, test-covered, modular, and enhanced portfolio & blog platform ready for both developer and non-developer audiences, with clear documentation and automated tests ensuring future maintainability.
