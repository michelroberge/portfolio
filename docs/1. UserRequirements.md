# User Requirements for Portfolio Website

## Personality & Tone
- **Perception**: Creative, innovative problem solver, approachable expert, technical mentor, fun, easygoing.
- **Tone**: Friendly, witty, minimalist.
- **Storytelling**: Career journey timeline and anecdotes from key projects.

## Core Objectives & Features
- **Main Purpose**: Showcase talent and projects to attract high-profile job offers.
- **Primary Audience**:
  1. Fellow developers
  2. Industry leaders
  3. Recruiters / Potential Clients
- **Visitor Interaction**:
  1. AI Chat
  2. Semi-structured browsing

## Content Prioritization
- **Must-Haves**:
  - Career timeline
  - AI chatbot
  - Project showcase
  - Live demos
- **Nice-to-Haves**:
  - Blog
- **Project Showcase Format**: Just a link (either on GitHub or self-hosted with a reverse proxy).
- **Blog/Industry Insights**: Maybe, but not a priority.

## AI & Interactivity
- **AI Chat**:
  - Random greeting + guided prompt suggestions.
  - Freeform conversation allowed.
  - AI should distinguish between generic data and user-specific knowledge.
- **Search Functionality**:
  - AI-powered search (e.g., "Show me projects using C# and MongoDB").
  - Qdrant should index both project descriptions and full project source code.
  - Everything should be locally hosted (no external embeddings).
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Career timeline should be D3-like interactive (zoom, forward/backward movement).
  - Skills map should be drillable from broad categories to code snippets.

## Technical Considerations
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js with MongoDB.
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted on a local server.
- **Search**: Qdrant for indexing projects and source code.
- **AI Chat**: Ollama for chatbot interactions.
- **Performance & Privacy**: Everything runs locally; no external dependencies for embeddings or AI models.
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker for automated deployment.
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based authentication instead of bearer tokens.

## Development Approach
- **Start with Frontend First**: Mock API calls before integrating the backend.
- **Global State Management**:
  - Search should have a `SearchContext` and `SearchProvider` for global accessibility.
  - Chat should have a `ChatContext` and `ChatProvider` for global availability.
- **Landing Page Layout**:
  - AI chat should be site-wide, not just on a dedicated page.
  - Main sections:
    - "Time Machine" (Career Timeline)
    - "Philosophy" (Skills & Problem-Solving Map)
    - "Projects" (Live Demos, Searchable)
    - "Contact Me" (Engaging Form)
  - Clicking a section expands it, shrinking others into a sidebar.
- **Final Features**:
  - AI-powered guidance with optional interactivity.
  - Running live demos from pet projects.

## Next Steps
1. **Continue with frontend development**:
   - Search component should be fully functional and globally accessible.
   - AI Chat should be site-wide and utilize `ChatContext`.
2. **Integrate real backend API calls** for search and chat functionalities.
3. **Deploy and test CI/CD automation** using Jenkins and Docker.
