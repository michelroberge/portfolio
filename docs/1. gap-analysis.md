# Gap Analysis Document

## Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website intended for distribution and reuse by developers—with future enhancements to make it accessible to non-coders. The system is built as a full-stack application with a Next.js frontend and a Node.js/Express backend using MongoDB (via Mongoose) for storage. It is deployed via Docker Compose.

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend (portfolio.next/):**
  - Built with Next.js and TypeScript.
  - Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design (supports large vs. small screens).
  - Implements basic pages for the blog, projects, admin dashboard, and user authentication.
  - Includes light in-memory caching for performance.
- **Backend (portfolio.node/):**
  - An Express.js application managing authentication, blog CRUD, project CRUD, and comment data.
  - Uses Mongoose for MongoDB models (users, blog posts, projects, etc.).
- **Deployment:**
  - Docker Compose is used for containerized deployment of both frontend and backend services.
- **Existing Features:**
  - Admin login and first-level authentication.
  - Basic blog and project management.
  - A simple admin dashboard.
  - Responsive design and some caching mechanisms.

## Identified Gaps & Future Requirements
1. **Customization & Configurability**
   - **Site Settings:** Allow admins to easily update site title, description, and theme settings via configuration files.
   - **Theme Customization:**
     - Support for light/dark mode for end-users with their preferences stored in the database.
     - Admin-driven theme customization via Tailwind configuration (using current best practices).

2. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - **Consumer Authentication:** Extend authentication to support OAuth2/OpenID Connect for users leaving comments.
   - **Admin Authentication:** Maintain local auth for administrators, with a first-time setup flow and subsequent admin additions only via existing admins.

3. **Comment System Improvements**
   - **Threaded Comments:** Enable nested replies.
   - **Moderation:** Allow admins to mark comments as "redacted" instead of deleting them.
   - **Security:** Implement rate limiting (handled by Nginx), and support user and email domain blocking.
   - **Storage:** Use MongoDB/Mongoose for storing comments.

4. **Content Management Enhancements**
   - **Drafts & Scheduling:** Allow blog posts and projects to be saved as drafts or scheduled for future publication.
   - **Content Format:** Transition blog post content to Markdown, rendered to HTML dynamically.
   - **Editability:** Enable updates to published content, with updates reflecting on the “last updated” date.

5. **Admin Panel Enhancements**
   - **Content & Comment Management:** Expand the admin interface to manage comments (including redaction and blocking), blog posts, and projects.
   - **OAuth2/OIDC Provider Configuration:** Allow admins to configure external identity providers.
   - **Telemetry & Analytics:** Collect and display basic statistics—such as number of users, sessions, and page hits—using a telemetry schema stored in MongoDB.
   - **Admin Onboarding:** Implement a first-time setup flow for creating the initial admin account, with subsequent admin additions managed by existing admins.

6. **Search Functionality**
   - **Basic Text Search:** Implement MongoDB full-text search across blog posts and projects (title, description, and body).

7. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - **SEO:** Enhance SEO with meta tags, structured data, and an SEO-friendly layout.
   - **Accessibility:** Ensure accessibility by adhering to HTML/React standards.
   - **Internationalization:** Prepare the system for future translations (e.g., support for French).
   - **Performance:** Maintain a fast and lightweight application through in-memory caching and optimized code.

8. **Deployment**
   - **Docker-Compose:** Continue using a Docker Compose file as the sole deployment mechanism.

## Conclusion
The gap analysis highlights the need to expand configuration and content management capabilities, enhance the comment and authentication systems, and provide additional admin panel features. In parallel, non-functional aspects like SEO, accessibility, internationalization, and performance must be addressed to create a robust, distributable personal portfolio platform ready for both developer and non-developer audiences.
