# User Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
The portfolio platform is a self-hosted, AI-enhanced personal website designed to showcase the developer's experience, projects, and insights. It includes AI-powered interactions, a structured career timeline, a blog, and an interactive project showcase.

## 2. Goals & Scope
**Key Features:**
- AI-powered chatbot that answers questions based on blog entries, projects, and timeline data.
- Full CRUD support for blogs, projects, and career timeline entries.
- AI embeddings for enhanced search capabilities.
- Search combining full-text indexing and semantic embeddings.
- Admin dashboard for managing all content.
- UI for configuring the AI model and embeddings system.
- UI for application configuration (Title, Subtitle, Motto).
- Support for multi-language content translation via AI.

## 3. User Roles & Access Control
- **Admin:** Full access to CRUD operations for blogs, projects, timeline events, and AI configurations.

## 4. AI Chatbot & Search Functionalities
- AI chatbot interacts **without persisting chat history outside a session**.
- Admin-configurable choice between **Ollama and OpenAI API** at the site level (toggle during setup).

- No immediate plans for monetization.
- No MFA support for admin users.
